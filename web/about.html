<p><font size="3">Our aim by using this project is to develop an Online crime reporting system.
This system is easily accessible by all normal public, the police department & 
the administrative department </font> 
</p>
<p><font size="3">This system is developed because the normal public is afraid to report a complaint against
any crime going around them. so by using this system the normal public can easily report
a complaint against any dangerous criminals to their respective police station
</font> 
</p>
<p><font size="3">This police station share information with different police stations, which help them 
in catching criminals keeping records of all criminals will help police to keep tab
on criminal to perform legal activities. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="3">By using this system, the record work is reduced and the data stored in computer is more
confidential then a paper work. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="3">The other advantages on this is people can view the enquiry about complaints,
status of  complaints and other information. </font>
</p>
